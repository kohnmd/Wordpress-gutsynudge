Abundance,"Abundance, money","Abundance is a feeling, it feels like that Thanksgiving picture of the cornucopia overflowing. Money is not the only thing that makes you abundant: friendship, experience, food, joy, dancing, family, free time, creativity, travel, and an innumerable amount of other qualities can make us feel rich in our life. In order to continue to attract abundance we can look at where in our lives we are already rich so that we can continue to expand and overflow. Gutsy Writer -Nicole Sacchitella",
Abundance,Abundance,"Life naturally produces more than enough. Plants make more than enough seeds, mothers make more than enough milk, there is more than enough water, air, soil, and energy for all beings on the planet. Scarcity is a fallacy because life is not scarce. When the feeling of scarcity comes up, remember your are a being of infinite potential, infinite imagination, infinite creativity, infinite energy and infinite abundance because you are a being born of an infinite universe.

Anger,Anger,"There is a lot in this world to get angry about. Pisses you off right? Makes you mad? Well, if seeing people do mean things or act violent make you want to kill them, then they won. If you want to stop the ping pong game of anger in this world you have to find a way to have compassion for the people that you think are the worst! It is not an easy task but if Jesus did it, so can you. Gutsy writer - Julie Cobb",
Anger,Anger,"Anger is natural and so is joy, each are seeds that blow in the wind of existence and sometimes take root in our own being. We nurture the seeds of anger by harboring it, holding on to it, and growing attached to it. Anger doesn't have to take root, especially if we are able to release it when it comes up and crowd out the soil of our being by watering the seeds of joy. Gutsy Writer -Nicole Sacchitella",
Anger,Anger,"In the name of love sometimes we are afraid to let ourselves get angry, but isn't it the most loving to honor how you feel and to be honest? If you really love someone let yourself be honest with them, if you really love yourself let yourself feel any emotion you have. Gutsy Writer- Nicole Sacchitella",
Anger,,"We all have anger. The difference is whether we learned to hold on to it, or let it go. If you have anger try finding a safe and constructive way to let go of it, that only involves you. Maybe screaming in the car or into a pillow. Letting go of anger for the sake of letting go of anger, makes room for what you want. Gutsy writer - Julie Cobb",
Anger,,"Animals shake off after they get into a fight. Shake off as if, they are letting go of the anger from the fight. If you feel angry, maybe try shaking off like an animal. Sometimes animals can show us the simple answer. Gutsy writer - Julie Cobb",
BOUNDARIES,,"If you think that someone around you has poor boundaries and annoys you, then guess what? Its actually you that has the poor boundaries. The only way to teach someone else to have boundaries, is to honor your own. Know how you feel and express or take action on it! Gutsy Writer - Julie Cobb",
BOUNDARIES,"BOUNDARIES,POWER, ","Often as kids we learn how to respond or react vs. feel. We talk about having good boundaries, but that takes knowing what you want. And knowing what you want taking knowing how you feel. Kids are the best at this. (""I am hungry and I want ice cream!"") As we move into our adult life, we tend to carry ideas, that actually have nothing to do with feeling.( ""I should work late, because my boss asked me to."") If you want an kind of true power in this world, you have to first know how you feel. Which statement is more powerful? ""I should work late, because my boss asked me to."" or "" I don't feel like working late, but I am going to"". One statement acknowledges how you feel and honors your body and they other does not. Even if the outcome is the same, the power you hold within it can be different! Gutsy Writer - Julie Cobb",
Boundaries,,There are only two things that you have control of in this lifetime. What you feel and what you want. Everything else is out of your control. So ask yourself if you are trying to control something outside of those two things. Gutsy writer - Julie Cobb,

Breaking up / Divorce,,"Think about what you just experienced. Write down what you liked and what you could leave behind. Think of relationships as an opportunity to experience. As we grow, those experiences become more defined. Get bossy with the universe and demand what you want next. You deserve it. Gutsy Writer - Julie Cobb",
Breaking up / Divorce,,Some trees in nature only seed when there is a forest fire. That means a clean slate is what creates new growth. Gutsy writer - Julie Cobb,
Breaking up / Divorce,,"Whether it was on your terms or not, it was meant to happen. If you catch yourself thinking about what YOU did wrong, you are going to attract the same pattern in your next relationship. Get really curious about how you really felt, how you feel and how you want to feel. That is powerful. Try not to get caught up in the logistics of the relationship and focus on your next desired feeling. Gutsy Writer - Julie Cobb",
Breaking up / Divorce,,"There are stages to mourning. Anger comes first. As beautiful, loving and healing beings we sometimes skip anger and go right into sadness or forgiveness, because we were taught that anger is not polite. Well, fuck that! Don't forget to get pissed! Let your anger out! Otherwise, there is no room for what you want next. Gutsy writer - Julie Cobb",
Breaking up / Divorce,,"Children know how to do it. They know two things, what they feel and what they want. Those two things are the key to life and attracting. You may be broken wide open right now and use that vulnerability to get really clear. How do you feel and what do you want? Use the language of emotions. Gutsy writer - Julie Cobb ",
Cancer,Cancer,"What can be scary about cancer is that you might die. However, we are all going to die. That is the fact. Thinking about death means you are not being in the present moment. What is in question is how we are going to live. Let cancer change how you live in the present moment. Gutsy Writer - Julie Cobb",
Cancer,,"The body has an amazing way to tell you to change. If you are holding a hot potato, your hand says ouch and tells you to change what you are doing by dropping the potato. Cancer is no different. Your body is telling you to change something. Get curious as to what that might be. Gutsy Writer - Julie Cobb",
Cancer,Cancer,"The energy of a healthy body is one where the cells are all working in harmony to achieve equilibrium. A body with cancer has cells that are working out of harmony with the rest but all cells are still trying to attain a state of health. For each person the question is, ""What function are my cancer cells trying to serve in my body and why are they separate from the rest?"" For some people it may be that they are holding a repressed feeling, but essentially those cells which contain that essence are alienated from the rest. Parts of your body holding a feeling or pattern that isn't ""allowed"" to be integrated with the rest of the body lack harmony with the rest of the cells in your body. When healing cancer examine what state your body as a whole is trying to attain for optimum health, and what your cancer cells might actually be trying to accomplish. If they are in disharmony because they are holding an emotion or feeling apart from the rest of the body, give that energy or feeling a way to be integrated back into the whole. Gutsy Writer - Nicole Sacchitella",
Cancer,,"We can fight cancer or we can accept that we have cancer. Just an FYI, we all have cancer of somekind. Its just a matter of whether it has become physical or not.

Career,,"We spend 8 hours a day or more with our J-O-B. If you don't love it, realize that you are wasting 1/3 of your life suffering voluntarily. ""Voluntarily"" is the key word, indicating that you have a choice. Choose again.. Gutsy writer - Julie Cobb",
Career,,"If you are at a loss as to what you want to do in this world, start by getting really clear on how you want to feel. Would it matter if you were a street performer, if you were happy, fulfilled and made 100k a year? Our minds sometimes lead us down the wrong path with trying to control what things look like. Focus on how you want to feel, and then let the universe take care of what it looks like. Gutsy writer - Julie Cobb",
Career,,"Life would be simply boring if you had a great boss. What if you very experience at work was to simply stand in your power? First, you have to know how you feel in order to honor it. Feeling is powerful and expressing what you feel is exponentially powerful. In order to be powerful in any relationship, including the one with your boss, you have to know how you feel. Once you know how you feel, practice expressing it in little ways. Gutsy writer - Julie Cobb",
Career,money,"Warren Buffett (like one of the richest people ever...) said the best investment is yourself. I could not agree more. If you have an idea, chase it. If you have an invention, invent it.

Change,CHANGE,"Imagine we are each a river flowing from start to finish. Try as we might we can never step in the same place twice because the river will always move, and is always in flow. We don't have to force things to change, nor can we stop it instead we can accept change, because that is what is happening anyway . Gutsy Writer -Nicole Sacchitella",
Change,Change,"We are each living, organic beings. Our bodies and energies ebb and flow, constantly receiving input and stimulus from our world, just as plants and animals change with the seasons.Sometimes in order to remain in control we stifle the ebb or the flow, leaving us feeling out of balance in some way. To feel our best, we get to allow ourselves to change, just like trees get to be new in the spring, growing in the summer, fruiting in the fall and resting in the winter. Gutsy Writer- Nicole Sacchitella",
Change,Change,"The truth is that if you want something different in your life, you have to change to get it. If you think about the laws of attraction, you have to become what you want. Change has to happen. Change is uncomfortable, regardless of the situation, because we are embarking on the unknown. Patterns are familiar, change is not. If you want something different than you are getting now, change something. Gutsy writer - Julie Cobb",

Death,,"The real death is, not living while you are alive. Gutsy writer - Julie Cobb",
Death,Death,"We fear death because it is unknown. Tomorrow is unknown to us, because it hasn't happened yet. When we go to sleep at night we breathe a sigh of relief, finally getting to put an old day down and start a new one. Maybe death is like finally going to sleep at the end of a full day, and the only unknown is tomorrow. Gutsy Writer- Nicole Sacchitella",
DEPRESSION,,"I see depression more so as anxiety. I also see anxiety as of often related to thoughts of the past and thoughts of the future. What has happened or what could potentially happens. If you can feel and reconnect your innate survival skill to true intuition vs. thought, you might dissipate your anxiety. If it resonates, try bringing attention to feeling and self awareness. Check in with your body often. Are you tired? Hungry?Happy?Sad? If you are feeling or in the present moment through feeling. you typically wont have anxiety. Gutsy Writer - Julie Cobb",
DEPRESSION,"DEPRESSION,ANGER, SADNESS","Think of a ballon. You can only put so much air in it until it pops. Same thing with anger. Did you learn as a kid to hold in anger? Did your parents think it wasn't acceptable or polite? News flash….Everyone has anger. What is different, is whether we hold it in or let it go. If it resonates, find a constructive way to get rid of anger (screaming in the car or punching pillow). This release should not include another live being.

Deserving,Manifesting/ deserving,"A lot of times we don't think we can have what we want because we ""don't deserve it."" Deserving is an old concept our parents and teachers used to help us do our homework and eat our vegetables. We are free beings who can have dessert if we want it, not only because we finished our plates. You don't even have to eat dinner if you want dessert. You are free to have anything you want in this life. Gutsy writer -Nicole Sacchitella",
Deserving,Deserving/ manifesting ,"A child does not deserve to get born into abuse. The company CEO does not deserve a BMW for his birthday. You did not deserve to get sick. Things happen.

Deserving,Deserving/ Manifesting/ growth,"In nature, a seed can be blown by the wind and land anywhere from a crack in the concrete to really fertile soil. Both seeds can grow and thrive.

Deserving,manifesting,"Are you doing all the ""right"" things to manifest what you want and still seem stuck? Ask yourself if you are ready to have XYZ, if it showed up on your porchstep tomorrow. Do you feeling like you deserve to have it? Deserving is an important part of actually getting what you want. If you push away compliments and always pay people back, then you might not be ready to have what you want. Practice just saying ""thank you"" when someone gives you something.

EMOTIONS,EMOTIONS,"Sometimes we identify with our emotions, but energetically we are just the container where our emotions happen. We can sit and admire the fish at the aquarium: red ones, blue ones, toothy ones and appreciate them all as they come and go.

EMPATHY,"PAIN,EMPATHY","Some people in this world are better at feeling into other people's energy than our own! I believe empathy is our human gift an connection.

However if you leave an interaction feeling drained, you are probably holding it.",
Family,Family,"I never knew I was a yeller... then I had kids. Yep, I am a yeller. I think it is a parental style of sorts. When you become a parent, you don't know what kind of parent you will be. You probably have an idea of the parent you would like to be, but then the child is born. And guess what? They have their own agendas too. They are little beings with their own path ahead of them. It is an honor to be a part of my kids lives. I get to be their mother... it is an incredible experience. I love them beyond words. And often times I find myself yelling. Sometimes I yell because I am mad, but mostly I yell because I am simply trying to be heard. Big, little, it doesn't matter, we all want to be heard. Gutsy blogger - Tyler Stroebel",

FEELINGS,"FEELINGS,SADNESS","Image you have a spirit (energy) inside of a physical body. They way to experience the spirit (energy) is to feel. A low energy might feel like sadness. I high energy might feel like joy. Once you feel, then you decide whether you want to keep that energy or let go of it. Regardless, if you want to feel connected or feel your spirit...it takes tuning into how you feel. Maybe wear something like a ring or bracelet to remind you to feel. Gutsy Writer - Julie Cobb",

Gutsy Writer- Nicole Sacchitella",
Healing,"Healing, Relationships","It is natural to want to help other people, especially the people we love. As sensitive beings we are often consciously and unconsciously trying to heal other people. The truth is that we have other people in our lives so that we can heal ourselves. If for example we have a person who is very judgmental towards us and we try to prove to her we are good enough in order to please him or her, we are invalidating ourselves, potentially hurting ourselves and affirming a painful pattern in another person. If instead we tried to did what felt best to us, maybe that person could relate to us in a new way that wasn't charged with our need to change their behavior or feelings. Only when we take care of ourselves, can we help anyone else. Gutsy writer- Nicole Sacchitella",

Health,Health,"The body is our physical container for not just what we can see and feel, but also for the things that go unseen and under appreciated. There is so much activity processing on the cellular level, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. Our physical bodies have to find a way to contain all of that!

Letting Go,Letting go,"The notion of ""letting go"" is literally seen as dropping something from your grasp. People often expect to let go of a memory, a time, a pattern or a person and expect that act to somehow erase whatever has happened. I find that letting go of something inside of us is actually an act of pulling that which we want to to drop closer. By honoring that part of ourselves more we are able to examine it and accept it more deeply, and in that acceptance we are actually able to move on and grow. Gutsy Writer -Nicole Sacchitella",
Letting go,Patterns,"Changing a pattern is tough. No matter what the pattern is. However, if you are reading this, you are probably done with that pattern anyway.

Love,Love,"Love is cumulative and our capacity to love expands as our experience does: when we are born love means our parents hold and care for us, when we are children love means putting gum in our crush's hair and as we get older love accumulates all of the experiences we have ever had with any one we have ever loved. The breadth of experience usually means intensity, transcendence, beauty and loss. It is all of those things that bring us a fuller understanding of how powerful it is to love. When something breaks our heart it breaks open the boundaries of our experience so that we may love bigger, wider and deeper. Gutsy Writer- Nicole Sacchitella",

MANIFESTING,,"Our brains are powerful. But, our brains are not as powerful as our spirit. At the end of the day, we all just want to feel good. Our brains think that we know what is going to make us feel good. So we end up chasing those things. Money, relationship, power etc. Nothing is wrong with wanting any of those things, however, think about the laws of attraction and becoming the thing you are trying to attract. Do things to make yourself feel abundant, loved and strong! Feeling is an experience of energy and energy is what attracts, so become what you want! Gutsy Writer - Julie Cobb",
MANIFESTING,,"Think of a ballon. You can only put so much air in it until it pops. Same thing with anger. Did you learn as a kid to hold in anger? Did your parents think it wasn't acceptable or polite? News flash….Everyone has anger. However, if you have anger, even if it's from your childhood, it could be in the way of manifesting what you want and you need to make room. If it resonates, find a constructive way to get rid of anger (screaming in the car or punching pillow). This release should not include another live being. It is about releasing anger for the sake of releasing anger. Then, you can decide how you would like to fill the space you now have. Gutsy Writer - Julie Cobb",
Manifesting,MANIFESTING," Sometimes we get attached to the idea of something we want because it offers us a source of comfort and escape from a life we aren't ready to have change. Ask yourself what is it that you want? What would have to be different in order to have it? Getting something you want will change your life, and by living your change you will get what you want. Gutsy Writer -Nicole Sacchitella","Manifesting and getting what you want is largely about the laws of attraction. Knowing what you want is important, but we often forget about the energy it takes to attract it. How well do you know what your energy is attracting? Often we really know what we want, but sometimes get frustrated when it's not showing up. Manifesting is about being the energy of what you want. If you want love, its about being love. If you want abundance, its about being abundant. If you want freedom, its about being free. It is generally helpful to feel a certain way, in order to be it. However, it is not mandatory. There is a link between your thoughts, your perception and your energy. A person can be in prison, but still feel free. And person can be free and feel like they are in prison. Only one of those people has freedom. It can be hard to understand what our energy is doing, but feeling is a great way to gain that awareness. You can use feelings as a guidance of your energy. Your thoughts in some form will manifest into something. So its important to understand the energy of your thoughts, perception and how you might be experiencing them, with feelings. If your thoughts are predominately fear, then you may feel fear and then attract fear. Your energy can be formed by what you think. The more clear you are about what you think and the more present you are to it, the more you have the ability to shift your perception, feelings and energy. Your feelings can be a great source of guidance, in understanding what you are attracting. "
Manifesting,MANIFESTING,"When we have special person comes to our home, we make up their bed with new sheets, light some candles and cook them a nice meal. Treat what you want like it is special.

Manifesting,MANIFESTING,"A sapling does not try to become a big tree, instead it becomes a big tree because it is a sapling. If you are exhausting yourself to become something, try relaxing and see what form you take. Gutsy Writer -Nicole Sacchitella",
Manifesting,MANIFESTING,"A cow can't produce milk unless it has a hungry calf; we can want things for the sake of having them, however when we know what purpose they will serve only then are we able to attract them. Gutsy Writer- Nicole Sacchitella",

Manifesting,Manifesting,"The Law of Attraction states that you get what you put out there. This statement is both uplifting and daunting all at the same time. It says that we can create or manifest what we want in life. Hooray!!! But wait, does that mean that we can control everything that happens in our life? This is a common conundrum in the manifesting world. And for us control freaks, insanity is right around the corner. For this reason I live by two Laws... The Law of Attraction AND Shit Happens. Gutsy writer - Tyler Stroebel",
Manifesting,Manifesting,"Your true desires are the most sacred thing you have to offer in any given moment. Think about it: when you really know something you want, when you can really feel it, you have bridged an intimate part of your heart with a part of your knowing. By owning those desires and honoring them, whether that means saying them out loud, acting from them, writing them down or praying about it, you can birth that sacred part of yourself into the world. Gutsy Writer- Nicole Sacchitella",
Manifesting,Manifesting,"Seeing is believing...right? If you are able to see what your life will be and feel like when a dream is made reality you are able to make it happen. It is that vision on the horizon that gives us the path to walk towards. The place in time that holds your dream may be far off, but it can give you the means to walk in its direction, the path making itself apparent as you go along. Your dreams are tools to navigate from, the only way to get lost is to lose sight of them. Gutsy Writer- Nicole Sacchitella",
MONEY,MONEY,"Money is an energy. Just like water, love or food. First ask what your relationship to money is an how you would change it. Remember, money is more available if you 1. are ready to accept it. How accepting are you? 2. feel abundant already. Remember everything is the laws of attraction. Become what you want. In this moment, how can you make yourself feel more abundant? Gutsy Writer - Julie Cobb",
Money,,"Money is an energy, similar to air or water. We need to breathe out to breathe in. Where are you gripping on to money or restricting yourself in order to have more? That very gripping, most likely is insuring that you have less. Show the universe that you trust, by treating yourself. Gutsy writer - Julie Cobb",
Money,,"Money is paper with some pictures on it. Do you want more paper with pictures on it? Or do you want to feel wealthy and affluent? Even if you get more paper with pictures on it, you might not feel any better. The universe can deliver how you want to feel, sooner than it can try to predict your mind. So get clear on how you want to feel, not what you think is going to evoke a feeling, and ask for it. Gutsy writer - Julie Cobb",
PAIN,"DEPRESSION,COMPARISON,","There is no order of magnitude in pain or anything for that matter. So saying ""I should be grateful"" or ""I should be happy"" is never going to make your pain go away. What is the difference between some in Haiti struggling for food to survive and a person driving a BMW, who is so depressed they are also struggling to survive? The only difference is the experience, but the pain is the same. Stop telling yourself you should feel different. Try accepting yourself and how you feel regardless of your external circumstances. Resisting pain, does not make it go away. Gutsy Writer - Julie Cobb",
PAIN,"Depression, pain, anxiety","Pain, whether in the form of a paper cut, depression, cancer or anxiety, is the ultimate form of communication. Pain tells us ""do something different"" If you are holding a hot potato, your brain says ""shit girl, that's hot! Drop it!!!!!!"" Our bodies are brilliant at telling us to do things differently. So no matter your pain, what can you do differently? Diet? sleep? career? relationship? Gutsy Writer - Julie Cobb",
"PATTERNS, CHANGE","PATTERNS, CHANGE","Patterns are familiar and even if they don't serve us, they can become comfortable. We might logically know that something is not good for us, but the illusion of predictability and familiarity keeps us doing it. Until, that is, when we reach a point where we are just sick of repeating the pattern. Change is scary only because it is unpredictable. Make the safety of change predictable, by challenging yourself to do things that are unpredictable, even if they have nothing to do with your struggle in mind. Gutsy Writer - Julie Cobb",
POWER,"POWER, MANIFESTING, HEALTH","Nothing in this universe is more powerful than you. Whatever you are struggling with, you have the power to change it. Afterall, you had the power to create it. Gutsy Writer - Julie Cobb",
Prayer,Prayer,"I have never thought of prayer as the act of humbly asking a greater force to have pity on you, instead I see it as letting Spirit know that you are ready for how you want it to be. Gutsy Writer- Nicole Sacchitella",
Prayer,Prayer,"Whatever prayer means to each of us personally, no matter who we think hears what we say, it is powerful. In simple terms we state something true to our heart so that 'something else' hears us. No matter if we say it so that we hear it, our higher-self hears it, our unconscious hears it, our body hears it, our spirit hears it, a guardian angel hears it, or some power we feel is greater than us hears it, we are putting a truth from our heart out into the world so that something can be done. Gutsy Writer -Nicole Sacchitella",
Prayer,Prayer,"When praying, think about the energy behind the prayer. Are you praying from a place of lack OR are you praying from a place of trust and knowing? Gutsy Writer - Tyler Stroebel ",
Purpose,,"Often we get stuck in wondering, ""what's my purpose?"" We tend to focus on what we are supposed to do vs. who we are. The truth is who we are turns into, what we do. Think of them as interchangeable. Think of what you do as an expression of who you are. If you want to find your purpose, imagine yourself doing certain things and take notes on what makes you smile. If you imagine yourself as a vet, then you are probably a helper or nurturer. If you imagine yourself as a pro surfer, then you are probably a free spirit. If you imagine yourself as a CEO, then you are probably a leader. Take a moment and dream for a minute and see yourself doing something that you think you would love. Take note on what makes you smile and acknowledge how you feel as you visualize yourself doing that thing. The truth is that you don't need to be a vet to help, or a surfer to feel free or a CEO to lead. Our mind leads us to the thing that evokes the feeling, when the feeling is all that matters. Think of your purpose, as becoming a feeling. Allow the universe to take care of what it actually looks like, and just focus on becoming the feeling. Be nurturing, or free or leading in whatever you do. How you do something is more important than what you do. Being something, can happen today and when you start the practice of being in the feeling of what you want, then coincidentally what you do in this world will become the same.",
Purpose,Purpose,"The purpose of an axe is to cut wood...or is it? What if that axe is in your garage on a windy day and you use it to hold the door open? What if years later you use that same axe as a trellis for a flowering vine to grow in your garden? What if years later a fire fighter uses that axe out of your garden to open the front door of your neighbor's burning house? Purpose meanders beyond any hard and fast definition as time goes on. Your purpose is to be you at any given moment, and in any given moment the way you fit is your purpose. Gutsy Writer- Nicole Sacchitella",
Purpose,Purpose,"The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. If you look at any organism every part works together in its own way to create a harmony and balance. The purpose of the heart is to pump blood to get oxygen to all of the cells. The purpose of the mitochondria to produce energy to feed all of the cells so that they can continue to fulfill their purpose. The purpose of the skin is to protect all of the interior workings of the body. On and on, each of these parts works perfectly in harmony with the others. There is no purpose too great or too small, for each part works together to sustain the wholeness of the universe. Gutsy Writer- Nicole Sacchitella",
Purpose,Purpose,"We can get stuck on 'purpose' preceding 'the thing itself,' when really 'purpose' is what happens after 'the thing' comes into being. A tree did not start producing oxygen and shade and shelter and wood because that was its purpose, instead those things came out of its being. Your purpose is to come into being, to nurture every part of you and from your being you discover how you fit, how you help, and how you naturally add to the synergy of all of creation. Gutsy Writer- Nicole Sacchitella",
Purpose,Purpose,"Never was there a tree in history that tried to be anything other than itself. An acorn never grew to be a palm, a pine never grew from an apple seed. One day each grew, effortlessly with all of the means it had to create its own bark, make its leaves, and grow its roots. Your purpose is to be effortlessly you. Gutsy Writer- Nicole Sacchitella",

Relationships,Relationships,"The truth is that every relationship you have is a reflection of the relationship you have to yourself.

Relationships,Arguments,"Feeling conflicted or frustrated in this argument? Ask yourself, is it more important to be right or kind in this moment... in this relationship? Gutsy writer - Tyler Stroebel",
Relationships,Relationships,"In a relationships we create an energy exchange pattern with another person. Some of us are ""givers"" in some relationships sometimes and some of us are ""receivers"" in other relationships other times. We are not the passive recipients of other people's energy however, instead we work together to co-create an energy dynamic with another person. We teach other people how to treat us. If you want something different out of your relationship your must first hold your energy differently, this gives the other person's energy room to respond. Gutsy Writer- Nicole Sacchitella",
Relationships,Relationships,"Every part of every relationship with every person in every moment is sacred. We are energy-beings who are constantly attracting people and situations to help us heal and expand ourselves.

Gutsy Writer- Nicole Sacchitella",
Relationships,Relationships,"The connotation of the word ""soulmate"" infers that there is only one. Most people ask themselves ""When will I meet my soulmate?"" The truth is we have lots of soul mates and they come in many different forms. If we start to rethink our relationships as ""opportunities to learn lessons and reflect on ourselves"" then suddenly everyone who is in our life is of equal importance, they have all come into our lives to expand and enrich our soul.

RELATIONSHIPS,"LOVE, WORK","No matter what the dynamic of the relationship, you have a mirror. If you admire that person, they are a reflection of you. If that person triggers you, they are a reflection of you. Just know that if they are triggering you, there is something that you can heal within yourself based on that trigger. Maybe the trigger is trust or control. Regardless, the actual trigger, look at where within your life might you be controlling or not trusting, even if it doesn't look the same as the person triggering you.",
Relationships,"RELATIONSHIPS, ",Imagine creation to be one giant mirror which broke apart into an infinite number of pieces so that It could witness itself.

The things that drive you crazy about the other person are you too. Gutsy Writer -Nicole Sacchitella,
Relationships,Relationships,"Being of service to others often is our first impulse, and it is natural to put ourselves and our own needs on the back burner. Have you ever noticed that on airplanes they remind passengers to secure their own oxygen first in the event of a crisis, before helping others? To be the most effective, the most helpful, the most of service we must make sure that we are taken care of first, this not only sets and example for others, but is also ensures that our helpful nature comes from a place of an overabundance-- we will feel so good we can't help but be helpful to someone else. Gutsy Writer- Nicole Sacchitella",
Relationships,Relationships,"We attract relationships that help us heal ourselves. If we find we are in a pattern of trying or wanting to heal someone else, it is simply because we are trying to heal something within ourselves. Examine what it is about the other person we want to help or fix or support or change, and see how that corresponds to yourself. Other people are mirrors for our own being, we see in them what we have contained in ourselves. Gutsy Writer - Nicole Sacchitella",

"RELATIONSHIPS, PATTERNS","RELATIONSHIPS, PATTERNS","Patterns are a funny thing! A great example is in relationships and the person who keeps attracting the same kind of person. You will keep attracting that same person until you can become a different person in the relationship. Patterns will keep showing up until you don't match the energy anymore. So let the pattern, show up, but what can you do differently. How can you change who you are? Gutsy Writer - Julie Cobb",
RESISTANCE,"RESISTANCE, MANIFESTING, ","The energy of resistance is powerful. Think of resistance as control and think of control as a closed door. Do you want something in this world but are struggling to get it? It is a lot easier for the universe to usher something though an open door versus a closed door. Think of acceptance as the open door. Think about where in your life you resist yourself. For example: Maybe you wanted to buy an outfit, but told yourself it's too expensive.That is resistance. Regardless, find where you tell yourself you cant have what you want and practice doing the opposite. Gutsy Writer - Julie Cobb",
Resistance,,"The first step to having what you want, is to stop resisting what you have. Accept your present moment and all of the learning that has come with it. Accepting it is NOT telling the universe that you want it. It is saying ""I acknowledge that I am experiencing what I don't want, in order to know what I do."" Experience of what we don't want is important to know what we do want. Acceptance is powerful, resistance is weak and contrast is needed to know what we want next. Gutsy writer - Julie Cobb ",
SACRIFICE,"sacrifice, MANIFESTING","Often as kids we learn to sacrifice. Like, you have to work hard to be rich or if you want to serve or help people, you have to be poor. Sacrifice is the idea that you have to give up one thing to get another. Maybe the universe does not act like that.

TRUST,,"We often get caught up in giving power to other people or things or placing trust within them. IE: I trust my boss will give me that promotion or I trust my partner wont cheat on me.
